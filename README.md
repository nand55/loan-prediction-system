# loan-prediction system
 -An Machine learning based  model that predicts the eligibility criteria of any individual based on various parameters given as input.
 -Using two models as training and testing data set to develop a model that makes a prediction over a period of time by improving it's accuracy over a period of time .

 - For the front end : HTML and CSS are used as framework to design a simple website which is hosted on https://localhost8080 
 - A virtual Xampp server is used as database of PHP and MYSQL that stored the data of every user's prediction.

  How to run ? 
  - Clone the repository and save on machine with proper name and path.
  -you'll need to download xampp server app on your machine as per your configuration and initalize the apache, php and mysql server (atleast 2 of them should run successfully)
  -Open the xampp server and go to the htdocs folder and paste the folder of the project in it.
  -Open the browser and type localhost8080 in the address bar and you'll be redirected to the home page of the website.
  -Or else open the code editor and directly run the file named as "app.py" and on terminal you will find a link at random port number and follwing it will visit you this website.

  P.S - This is a simple yet understanding  beginner based project developed using basic algorithms and techniques.
